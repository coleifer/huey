Consuming Tasks
===============

To run the consumer, simply point it at the "import path" to your application's
:py:class:`Huey` instance.  For example, here is how I run it on my blog:

.. code-block:: bash

    huey_consumer.py blog.main.huey --logfile=../logs/huey.log

The concept of the "import path" has been the source of a few questions, but its
actually quite simple.  It is simply the dotted-path you might use if you were
to try and import the "huey" object in the interactive interpreter:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from blog.main import huey

You may run into trouble though when "blog" is not on your python-path. To
work around this:

1. Manually specify your pythonpath: ``PYTHONPATH=/some/dir/:$PYTHONPATH huey_consumer.py blog.main.huey``.
2. Run ``huey_consumer.py`` from the directory your config module is in.  I use
   supervisord to manage my huey process, so I set the ``directory`` to the root
   of my site.
3. Create a wrapper and hack ``sys.path``.

.. warning::
    If you plan to use `supervisord <http://supervisord.org/>`_ to manage your consumer process, be sure that you are running the consumer directly and without any intermediary shell scripts. Shell script wrappers interfere with supervisor's ability to terminate and restart the consumer Python process. For discussion see `GitHub issue 88 <https://github.com/coleifer/huey/issues/88>`_.

.. _consumer-options:

Options for the consumer
------------------------

The following table lists the options available for the consumer as well as
their default values.

``-l``, ``--logfile``
    Path to file used for logging.  When a file is specified, by default Huey
    the logfile will grow indefinitely, so you may wish to configure a tool
    like ``logrotate``.

    Alternatively, you can attach your own handler to ``huey.consumer``.

    The default loglevel is ``INFO``.

``-v``, ``--verbose``
    Verbose logging (loglevel=DEBUG). If no logfile is specified and
    verbose is set, then the consumer will log to the console.

    **Note:** due to conflicts, when using Django this option is renamed to
    use ``-V``, ``--huey-verbose``.

``-q``, ``--quiet``
    Minimal logging, only errors and their tracebacks will be logged.

``-w``, ``--workers``
    Number of worker threads/processes/greenlets, the default is ``1`` but
    some applications may want to increase this number for greater throughput.
    Even if you have a small workload, you will typically want to increase this
    number to at least 2 just in case one worker gets tied up on a slow task.
    If you have a CPU-intensive workload, you may want to increase the number
    of workers to the number of CPU cores (or 2x CPU cores). Lastly, if you are
    using the ``greenlet`` worker type, you can easily run tens or hundreds of
    workers as they are extremely lightweight.

``-k``, ``--worker-type``
    Choose the worker type, ``thread``, ``process`` or ``greenlet``. The default
    is ``thread``.

    Depending on your workload, one worker type may perform better than the
    others:

    * CPU heavy loads: use "process". Python's global interpreter lock prevents
      multiple threads from running simultaneously, so to leverage multiple CPU
      cores (and reduce thread contention) run each worker as a separate
      process.
    * IO heavy loads: use "greenlet". For example, tasks that crawl websites or
      which spend a lot of time waiting to read/write to a socket, will get a
      huge boost from using the greenlet worker model. Because greenlets are so
      cheap in terms of memory, you can easily run tens or hundreds of them.
    * Anything else: use "thread". You get the benefits of pre-emptive
      multi-tasking without the overhead of multiple processes. A safe choice
      and the default.

``-n``, ``--no-periodic``
    Indicate that this consumer process should *not* enqueue periodic tasks.
    If you do not plan on using the periodic task feature, feel free to use
    this option to save a few CPU cycles.

``-g``, ``--no-global-scheduler``
    Indicate that this consumer process should *not* use global scheduler.
    Use this options if you plan to run scheduler on multiple instances and you
    want periodic tasks to be enqueued multiple times (once per instance).

``-d``, ``--delay``
    When using a "polling"-type queue backend, the amount of time to wait
    between polling the backend.  Default is 0.1 seconds. For example, when the
    consumer starts up it will begin polling every 0.1 seconds. If no tasks are
    found in the queue, it will multiply the current delay (0.1) by the backoff
    parameter. When a task is received, the polling interval will reset back to
    this value.

``-m``, ``--max-delay``
    The maximum amount of time to wait between polling, if using weighted
    backoff.  Default is 10 seconds. If your huey consumer doesn't see a lot of
    action, you can increase this number to reduce CPU usage and Redis traffic.

``-b``, ``--backoff``
    The amount to back-off when polling for results.  Must be greater than
    one.  Default is 1.15. This parameter controls the rate at which the
    interval increases after successive attempts return no tasks. Here is how
    the defaults, 0.1 initial and 1.15 backoff, look:

    .. image:: http://media.charlesleifer.com/blog/photos/p1472257818.22.png

``-c``, ``--health-check-interval``
    This parameter specifies how often huey should check on the status of the
    workers, restarting any that died for some reason. I personally run a dozen
    or so huey consumers at any given time and have never encountered an issue
    with the workers, but I suppose anything's possible and better safe than
    sorry.

``-C``, ``--disable-health-check``
    This option **disables** the worker health checks. Until version 1.3.0,
    huey had no concept of a "worker health check" because in my experience the
    workers simply always stayed up and responsive. But if you are using huey
    for critical tasks, you may want the insurance of having additional
    monitoring to make sure your workers stay up and running. At any rate, I
    feel comfortable saying that it's perfectly fine to use this option and
    disable worker health checks.

``-s``, ``--scheduler-interval``
    The frequency with which the scheduler should run. By default this will run
    every second, but you can increase the interval to as much as 60 seconds.

``-u``, ``--utc``
    Indicates that the consumer should use UTC time for crontabs.
    Default is True, so it is not actually necessary to use this option.

``-o``, ``--localtime``
    Indicates that the consumer should use localtime for crontabs.
    The default behavior is to use UTC everywhere.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Running the consumer with 8 threads, a logfile for errors only, and a very
short polling interval:

.. code-block:: bash

  huey_consumer.py my.app.huey -l /var/log/app.huey.log -w 8 -b 1.05 -m 1.0

Running single-threaded with periodict task support disabled. Additionally,
logging records are written to stdout.

.. code-block:: bash

    huey_consumer.py my.app.huey -v -n

Using multi-processing to run 4 worker processes.

.. code-block:: bash

    huey_consumer.py my.app.huey -w 4 -k process

Using greenlets to run 100 workers, with no health checking and a scheduler
granularity of 60 seconds.

.. code-block:: bash

    huey_consumer.py my.app.huey -w 100 -k greenlet -C -s 60

.. _consumer-shutdown:

Consumer shutdown
-----------------

The huey consumer supports graceful shutdown via ``SIGINT``. When the consumer
process receives ``SIGINT``, workers are allowed to finish up whatever task
they are currently executing.

Alternatively, you can shutdown the consumer using ``SIGTERM`` and any running
tasks will be interrupted, ensuring the process exits quickly.

.. _consumer-restart:

Consumer restart
----------------

To cleanly restart the consumer, including all workers, send the ``SIGHUP``
signal. When the consumer receives the hang-up signal, any tasks being executed
will be allowed to finish before the restart occurs.

.. _consumer-internals:

Consumer Internals
------------------

This section will attempt to explain what happens when you call a
``task``-decorated function in your application. To do this, we will go into
the implementation of the consumer. The `code for the consumer <https://github.com/coleifer/huey/blob/master/huey/consumer.py>`_
itself is actually quite short (couple hundred lines), and I encourage you to
check it out.

The consumer is composed of three components: a master process, the scheduler,
and the worker(s). Depending on the worker type chosen, the scheduler and
workers will be run in their threads, processes or greenlets.

These three components coordinate the receipt, scheduling, and execution of
your tasks, respectively.

1. You call a function -- huey has decorated it, which triggers a message being
   put into the queue (Redis by default). At this point your application
   returns immediately, returning a :py:class:`TaskResultWrapper` object.
2. In the consumer process, the worker(s) will be listening for new messages
   and one of the workers will receive your message indicating which task to
   run, when to run it, and with what parameters.
3. The worker looks at the message and checks to see if it can be run (i.e.,
   was this message "revoked"? Is it scheduled to actually run later?).  If it
   is revoked, the message is thrown out. If it is scheduled to run later, it
   gets added to the schedule. Otherwise, it is executed.
4. The worker thread executes the task. If the task finishes, any results are
   published to the result store (provided you have not disabled the result
   store). If the task fails, the consumer checks to see if the task can be
   retried. Then, if the task is to be retried, the consumer checks to see if
   the task is configured to wait a number of seconds before retrying.
   Depending on the configuration, huey will either re-enqueue the task for
   execution, or tell the scheduler when to re-enqueue it based on the delay.

While all the above is going on with the Worker(s), the Scheduler is looking at
its schedule to see if any tasks are ready to be executed.  If a task is ready
to run, it is enqueued and will be processed by the next available worker.

If you are using the Periodic Task feature (cron), then every minute, the
scheduler will check through the various periodic tasks to see if any should
be run. If so, these tasks are enqueued.

.. warning::
    SIGINT is used to perform a graceful shutdown.

    When the consumer is shutdown using SIGTERM, any workers still
    involved in the execution of a task will be interrupted mid-task.

Events
------

As the consumer processes tasks, it can be configured to emit events. For
information on consumer-sent events, check out the :ref:`events` documentation.
