Managing shared resources
=========================

Tasks may need to make use of shared resources from the application, such as a
database connection or an API client.

The simplest approach is to manage the resource explicitly. For example, Peewee
database connections can be used as a context manager, so if we need to run
some queries inside a task, we might write:

.. code-block:: python

    database = peewee.PostgresqlDatabase('my_app')
    huey = RedisHuey()

    @huey.task()
    def check_comment_spam(comment_id):
        # Open DB connection at start of task, close upon exit.
        with database:
            comment = Comment.get(Comment.id == comment_id)

            if akismet.is_spam(comment.body):
                comment.is_spam = True
                comment.save()

Another option would be to write a decorator that acquires the shared resource
before calling the task function, and then closes it after the task has
finished. To make this a little simpler, Huey provides a special helper
:py:meth:`Huey.context_task` decorator that accepts an object implementing the
context-manager API, and automatically wraps the task within the given context:

.. code-block:: python

    # Same as previous example, except we can omit the "with db" block.
    @huey.context_task(database)
    def check_comment_spam(comment_id):
        comment = Comment.get(Comment.id == comment_id)

        if akismet.is_spam(comment.body):
            comment.is_spam = True
            comment.save()

Startup hooks
-------------

The :py:meth:`Huey.on_startup` decorator is used to register a callback that is
executed once when each worker starts running. This hook provides a convenient
way to initialize shared resources or perform other initializations which
should happen within the context of the worker thread or process.

As an example, suppose many of our tasks will be executing queries against a
Postgres database. Rather than opening and closing a connection for every task,
we will instead open a connection when each worker starts. This connection may
then be used by any tasks that are executed by that consumer:

.. code-block:: python

    import peewee

    db = PostgresqlDatabase('my_app')

    @huey.on_startup()
    def open_db_connection():
        # If for some reason the db connection appears to already be open,
        # close it first.
        if not db.is_closed():
            db.close()
        db.connect()

    @huey.task()
    def run_query(n):
        db.execute_sql('select pg_sleep(%s)', (n,))
        return n

.. note::
    The above code works correctly because `peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_
    stores connection state in a threadlocal. This is important if we are
    running the workers in threads (huey's default). Every thread will be
    sharing the same ``PostgresqlDatabase`` instance, but since the connection
    state is thread-local, each worker thread will see only its own connection.

Pre and post execute hooks
--------------------------

In addition to the :py:meth:`~Huey.on_startup` hook, Huey also provides
decorators for registering pre- and post-execute hooks:

* :py:meth:`Huey.pre_execute` - called right before a task is executed. The
  handler function should accept one argument: the task that will be executed.
  Pre-execute hooks have an additional feature: they can raise a special
  :py:class:`CancelExecution` exception to instruct the consumer that the task
  should not be run.
* :py:meth:`Huey.post_execute` - called after task has finished. The handler
  function should accept three arguments: the task that was executed, the
  return value, and the exception (if one occurred, otherwise is ``None``).

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from huey import CancelExecution

    @huey.pre_execute()
    def pre_execute_hook(task):
        # Pre-execute hooks are passed the task that is about to be run.

        # This pre-execute task will cancel the execution of every task if the
        # current day is Sunday.
        if datetime.datetime.now().weekday() == 6:
            raise CancelExecution('No tasks on sunday!', retry=False)

    @huey.post_execute()
    def post_execute_hook(task, task_value, exc):
        # Post-execute hooks are passed the task, the return value (if the task
        # succeeded), and the exception (if one occurred).
        if exc is not None:
            print('Task "%s" failed with error: %s!' % (task.id, exc))

.. note::
    Printing the error message is redundant, as the huey logger already logs
    any unhandled exceptions raised by a task, along with a traceback. These
    are just examples.
