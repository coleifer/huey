Using Huey with Django
======================

Huey comes with special integration for use with the Django framework.  This is
to accomodate:

1. Configuring your queue and consumer via django settings module.
2. Run the consumer as a management command.

Apps
----

``huey.djhuey`` must be included in the INSTALLED_APPS within the Django settings.py file.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'huey.djhuey',
        ...

Huey Settings
-------------

.. note::
    Huey settings are optional.  If not provided, Huey will default to using
    Redis running locally.

All configuration is kept in ``settings.HUEY``.  Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

    HUEY = {
        'backend': 'huey.backends.redis_backend',  # required.
        'name': 'unique name',
        'connection': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379},
        'always_eager': False, # Defaults to False when running via manage.py run_huey

        # Options to pass into the consumer when running ``manage.py run_huey``
        'consumer_options': {'workers': 4},
    }

Django DB Backend
-----------------

Huey comes with Django DB backend, that can use DB as queue storage.
It is fine to use in dev environment, but not recommended to use in production.
Do not forget to apply migration ``python manage.py migrate djhuey`` to use this backend.

.. code-block:: python

    HUEY = {
        'backend': 'huey.backends.django_backend',
        'name': 'default',
        'connection': {
            'alias': 'default',  # django db conection alias, 
        },
        'consumer_options': {
            'loglevel': logging.DEBUG,
            'workers': 2,
            # query db every two seconds
            'initial_delay': 2,
            'backoff': 1,
        }
    }


Running the Consumer
--------------------

To run the consumer, use the ``run_huey`` management command.  This command
will automatically import any modules in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` named
"tasks.py".  The consumer can be configured by the ``consumer_options``
settings.

In addition to the ``consumer_options``, you can also pass some options to the
consumer at run-time.

``-w``, ``--workers``
    Number of worker threads.

``-p``, ``--periodic``
    Indicate that this consumer process should start a thread dedicated to
    enqueueing "periodic" tasks (crontab-like functionality).  This defaults
    to ``True``, so should not need to be specified in practice.

``-n``, ``--no-periodic``
    Indicate that this consumer process should *not* enqueue periodic tasks.

For more information, check the :ref:`consumer docs <consuming-tasks>`.

Task API
--------

The task API is a little bit simplified for Django.  The function decorators
are available in the ``huey.djhuey`` module.

Here is how you might create two tasks:

.. code-block:: python

    from huey.djhuey import crontab, periodic_task, task

    @task()
    def count_beans(number):
        print '-- counted %s beans --' % number
        return 'Counted %s beans' % number

    @periodic_task(crontab(minute='*/5'))
    def every_five_mins():
        print 'Every five minutes this will be printed by the consumer'

Tasks that execute queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you plan on executing queries inside your task, it is a good idea to close
the connection once your task finishes.  To make this easier, huey provides a
special decorator to use in place of ``task`` and ``periodic_task`` which will
automatically close the connection for you.

.. code-block:: python

    from huey.djhuey import crontab, db_periodic_task, db_task

    @db_task()
    def do_some_queries():
        # This task executes queries. Once the task finishes, the connection
        # will be closed.

    @db_periodic_task(crontab(minute='*/5'))
    def every_five_mins():
        # This is a periodic task that executes queries.
