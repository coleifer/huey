huey, a little task queue
=========================

.. image:: http://media.charlesleifer.com/blog/photos/huey-logo.png

a lightweight alternative, huey is:

* written in python
* only dependency is the Python Redis client
* clean and simple APIs
* supports python versions 2.7, 3.4+

huey supports:

* multi-process, multi-thread or greenlet task execution models
* schedule tasks to execute at a given time, or after a given delay
* schedule recurring tasks, like a crontab
* automatically retry tasks that fail
* task result storage
* consumer publishes event stream, allowing high-fidelity monitoring

At a glance
-----------

Use the :py:meth:`~Huey.task` and :py:meth:`~Huey.periodic_task` decorators to
turn functions into tasks that will be run by the consumer:

.. code-block:: python

    from huey import RedisHuey, crontab

    huey = RedisHuey('my-app', host='redis.myapp.com')

    @huey.task()
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

    @huey.periodic_task(crontab(minute='0', hour='3'))
    def nightly_backup():
        sync_all_data()

Here's how to run the consumer with four worker processes (good setup for
CPU-intensive processing):

.. code-block:: console

    $ huey_consumer.py my_app.huey -k process -w 4

If your work-loads are mostly IO-bound, you can run the consumer with threads
or greenlets instead. Because greenlets are so lightweight, you can run quite a
few of them efficiently:

.. code-block:: console

    $ huey_consumer.py my_app.huey -k greenlet -w 32

Redis
-----

Huey's design and feature-set are, to a large extent, informed by the
capabilities of the `Redis <https://redis.io>`_ database. Redis is a fantastic
fit for a lightweight task queueing library like Huey: it's self-contained,
versatile, and can be a multi-purpose solution for other web-application tasks
like caching, event publishing, analytics, rate-limiting, and more.

Although Huey was designed with Redis in mind, the storage system implements a
simple API and many other tools could be used instead of Redis if that's your
preference. Huey ships with an alternative storage implementation that uses
:ref:`sqlite`.
