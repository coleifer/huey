Changelog
=========

v1.2.0
------

Removed the metadata APIs added in 1.1.0, as they seemed poorly-designed and 
altogether a decent idea terribly implemented. Perhaps something I'll revisit, 
but which should be easy to implement as a third-party library using the events
APIs.

* `AsyncData` is renamed to `TaskResultWrapper`.
* `Huey.result()` is a new method that provides the result of a task, given a
  task ID.
* Fixed a handful of bugs related to the error serialization.
* Change the default consumer log handler from RotatingFileHandler to the
  vanilla FileHandler class.

v1.1.2
------

I've added a new API for fetching a task's result given on the task's ID. You
can now call `huey.result(task_id)` and retrieve the result if the task has
finished executing. Additionally, the [Huey.result](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#Huey.result) 
method accepts the same parameters as [AsyncData.get](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#AsyncData.get),
allowing you to block for results, specify a timeout, etc.

There is also a new parameter on the above methods, ``preserve=False``. By
default, the result store will delete a task result once it has been read. Specifying
``preserve=True`` ensures the data is not removed.

v1.1.1
------

This is a small release with a couple minor bugfixes.

* Fixed task metadata serialization bug. #140
* Small cleanup to event iterator storage implementation.
* Updated [getting started documentation](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html)
  to reflect changes in the 1.x APIs.

v1.1.0
------

* Big changes to simplify the way ``Huey`` is instantiated. No changes should
  be necessary if already using ``RedisHuey``.
* Refactored the storage APIs and simplified the public interface. There is
  now a single object, whereas before there were 4 components (queue, result
  store, scheduler and event emitter).
* Added methods for retrieving and introspecting the pending task queue, the
  schedule, results, and errors.
* Errors can now be stored, in addition to regular task results.
* Added metadata methods for tracking task execution, errors, task duration,
  and more. These will be the building blocks for tools to provide some
  insight into the inner-workings of your consumers and producers.
* Many new events are emitted by the consumer, and some have parameters. These
  are documented [here](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/events.html).

v1.0.0
------

What follows is a description of the changes between 0.4.9 and 1.0.0. There are
some backwards-incompatible changes to be aware of as well as new options for
the consumer. Most APIs are the same, however.


Backwards incompatible changes:

* ``huey.djhuey`` moved to ``huey.contrib.djhuey``. You will need to update
  any import statements as well as your Django ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to
  reflect the new module path.
* Redis backend is now the only one available, and the corresponding code moved
  from ``huey.backends.redis_backend`` to ``huey.storage``.
* Removed the "RabbitMQ" and "SQLite" queue backends.
* Removed the ``-t`` and ``--threads`` option from the consumer. You should now
  use ``-w`` or ``--workers``.
* Removed the ``-p`` and ``--periodic`` no-op options from the consumer. These
  are enabled by default so the option had no meaning.
* The ``scheduler-interval`` option is configured using ``-s`` when previously
  it was ``-S``. Furthermore, this must be a value between 1 and 60.
* Removed the ``peewee_helpers`` module.


New features:

* The queue consumer now supports multi-process or multi-greenlet execution
  models (in addition to multi-threaded, which previously was the only option).
* Added `pending()`, `scheduled()` and `all_results()` methods to the `Huey`
  class to allow introspection of the Queue's state at the current moment in
  time.
